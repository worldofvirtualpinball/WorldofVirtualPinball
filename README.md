This is the ðŸ†•WoVP modding group - where like-minded people can join together to create a table or mod / reskin/ retheme some tables for the community. 
People will work together as a team on a project to be released under the WoVP Banner. We won't stand for any BS or politics, it's about having fun creating.
If you are creating a table ( to release under your name - fine ) and want some help ask in the group or on Discord.
We won't release WIP videos just some screenshots and teasers, these creations will be released FREE to everyone, and anybody who helps WILL be credited, there will be none of this "If I donate, can I get an early preview". 
All content will remain your property we will promote and showcase it.
If you're a coder, a graphics artist, or can do DMDs, B2S, loading screens etc... we would love to hear from you and for you to join us, we have a discord where separate channels will be created for the projects we are doing, 
and each channel will have a project leader(s).

Discord ( no expire invite )
https://discord.com/invite/PuRKKMceuf 

The most update versions will be help on the repo so you have easy access to them and "older" files will be moved to our mega for safe storage.

This is the main page but we will have seperate repo`s for tables/mod etc... that we are working on.
